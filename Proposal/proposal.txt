University of Oregon iOS Development Club Application for iOS Proposal
JD Paul
June 30, 2021

Overview:
    Tab bar at the bottom with three tabs left to right:
        - Welcome
        - Calendar
        - Executive Board and Advisors
    
    The application will store data in Cloud Kit and Core Data so that it can be updated at any time for all users to see.
    I plan to use UIKit to build out the application
    I plan to upload this application by August 31 to the app store for club members to download
    I also hope to port the data for this app to a website in the furutre
    Push notifications for events a day before and then an hour before them.

Welcome:
    - Provides basic information about the club including events, links to our website, and our mission
    - It does not need to be on Core Data as it is just static information that only needs to be updated when formal app updates are released
    - Maybe after I will add the data to Core Data/CloudKit (CD/CK) for the text

Calendar:
    - Probably the most complicated part
    - This will be a UITableView that orders the events from the top to bottom of the screen from soonest to farthest away event date wise
    - The events will be clickable and contain information about location, time, date, and an image (usually the location of the event)
    - The calendar data will live locally on CD and pulled from CK.
        - That way I will be able to update data through the CK portal
        - From https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/
            - Store your app’s data in iCloud and keep everything up-to-date across devices and on the web. Featuring efficient syncing, as well as simple monitoring and 
            management, it’s never been easier to build and grow your apps with CloudKit. Store private data securely in your users’ iCloud accounts for limitless scale 
            as your user base grows, and get up to 1PB of storage for your app’s public data.
    - Also, there will be a pull down to update the calendar feature

Executive Board and Advisors:
    - This will be implimented as vertical list similar to the calendar
    - There will be a few sections:
        - Executive board (President, Vice President, Secratary, etc)
        - Faculty Advisor (Eric Wills currently)
        - Alumnus Advisors (Franklin Smith, Nick Bonat)
    - Each person will have a picture of them on the left side of the cell in a circle boarder
    - To the right of their profile picture will be their name, contact information, and a description about who they are

Core Data/Cloud Kit:
    - I will have to learn hwo to use Cloud Kit with CD
    - I will impliment the application with Core Data and then impliment Cloud Kit with it
    Data Models:
        - Events
            - Properties: Date, Time, Description, Image, Location (this is a relationship)
        - Location
            - Address, City, Zip Code, State, Country
        - Members
            - peroperties: ProfilePicture, Name, Position, Description, email, phoneNumber?

    For now:
        - edit through the dashboard

    Ideally:
       - Login Button for admin
           - That would unlock adding and deleting events in the event page
           - And adding other admins
